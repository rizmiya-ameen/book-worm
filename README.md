# Project Proposal: Book Explorer And Virtual Bookshelf

[Visit the deployed website](https://rizmiya-bookworm.surge.sh/)

The idea is to create a virtual bookshelf where users can explore books, add them to their personal bookshelf, enabling them to organize and track their collection effectively. Users can click on a genre and explore a selection of books from that category, along with book details, including author information, release year, publisher, and descriptions.

## Features:

1. **Book Search**

2. **New Releases**

3. **Virtual Bookshelf:** Introduce the "My Shelf" feature, where users are allowed to create and customize their virtual bookshelves, such as "To-Read", "Reading" and "Completed." Users can organize their book collection based on reading progress and preferences.

4. **Favorites**

5. **Reviews and Ratings**

6. **Reading Recommendations:** Implement a feature that suggests similar or related books based on the user's current selection.

7. **Book Quotes:** Allow users to highlight and save their favorite quotes from books.

<!-- Uncomment the following features if they will be implemented in the future -->

<!-- 8. **Reading Tracker:** Enable users to track their progress and display reading statistics, such as total books read, average reading time, and most-read genre.

9. **Personal Notes:** Allow users to add personal notes or highlights to the books they are reading.

10. **Bookmarking:** Add a bookmarking feature that allows users to mark specific pages or sections within a book they are reading. This feature will make it easier for users to return to specific points in the book later. -->



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
