# Project Proposal: Book Worm And Virtual Bookshelf

[Visit the deployed website](https://rizmiya-bookworm.surge.sh/)

The idea is to create a virtual bookshelf where users can explore books, add them to their personal bookshelf, enabling them to organize and track their collection effectively. Users can click on a genre and explore a selection of books from that category, along with book details, including author information, release year, publisher, and descriptions.

## Features:

1. **Book Search**

2. **New Releases**

3. **Virtual Bookshelf:** Introduce the "My Shelf" feature, where users are allowed to create and customize their virtual bookshelves, such as "To-Read", "Reading" and "Completed." Users can organize their book collection based on reading progress and preferences.

4. **Favorites**

5. **Reviews and Ratings**

6. **Reading Recommendations:** Implement a feature that suggests similar or related books based on the user's current selection.

7. **Book Quotes:** Allow users to highlight and save their favorite quotes from books.
